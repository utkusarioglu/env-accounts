# Env-Accounts

Pull ethereum account information from .env file in a predictable and flexible
way.

## Rationale

In blockchain development, we regularly require multiple fake accounts to test
our code. There are many tools out there we need to integrate and most of them
come with their own preferred method for ingesting these accounts.

This library ease onboarding by allowing easy management of all of these
different data structures that essentially carry the same information.
